# CODESOFT
Welcome to the CodeSoft Internship Task repository! This repository has been created to provide you with all the necessary information and resources to successfully complete the internship task as a prospective intern at CodeSoft.

## Task Overview

## Task 1: To-Do List 
### A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a command-line application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists. <br>
• Create a list to store tasks, and add task names along with priority.<br>
• Allow multiple inputs. <br>
• Allow to update tasks as completed. <br>
• Allow printing tasks of the list. <br>
• Allow removal of the tasks in the list. <br>

## Task 2: Simple Calculator
### A simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations prompts the user to input two numbers and an operation choice to perform the calculation and display the result.
• Asks the user for two numbers along with the symbol of the operation to be performed.<br>
• Allow multiple trials in a run. <br>
• Allow printing results. <br>

## Task 3: Password Generator
### A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password. <br>
• User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.<br>
• Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length. <br>
• Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.<br>

## Task 4: Rock Paper Scissors Game 
### A traditional Rock Paper Scissor Game computerized to play with one user with its computer based on a command-line application.<br>
• User Input: Prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors.<br>
• Computer Selection: Generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer.<br>
• Game Logic: Determine the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.<br>
• Display Result: Show the user's choice and the computer's choice.<br>
• Display the result, whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie.<br>
• Score Tracking: Keep track of the user's and computer's scores for multiple rounds.<br>
• Play Again: Ask the user if they want to play another round.<br>

## Task 5: Contact Book
### A contact book application designed to replicate the traditional contact books storing  names, phone numbers, and email id's of people. <br>
• Contact Information: Store name, phone number, email, and address for each contact.<br>
• Add Contact: Allow users to add new contacts with their details.<br>
• View Contact List: Display a list of all saved contacts with names and phone numbers.<br>
• Search Contact: Implement a search function to find contacts by name or phone number.<br>
• Update Contact: Enable users to update contact details.<br>
• Delete Contact: Provide an option to delete a contact.<br>
